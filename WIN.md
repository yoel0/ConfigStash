# Parabellum: Windows Users
![LinuxVWindows](https://www.psychz.net/content/apr13/windows-vs-linux.png)
## Overview
We'll be installing all of the tools necessary to develop applications on a windows machine running a linux environment/linux machine.
For windows users, you'll be utilizing a built in feature called WSL2 or windows subsystem for linux.
**Windows users, you'll have sections that pertain specifically to your machine.** For example `Section 1 (Windows)`
## Objectives
- Install WSL2 (Windows)
- Install Fish and Oh-My-Fish
- Install NodeJS
- Install Python3
- Install Vercel
- Install Postgres
- Install MongoDB
- Install Git
## Installing WSL (Windows)
Open `powershell` as an **`admin`**. Once powershell opens, run the following within that shell:
```ps
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```
**NOTE**: In order to install WSL2, your machine must meet the following requirements:
> - For x64 systems: Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher.
> - For ARM64 systems: Version 2004 or higher, with Build 19041 or higher.
> - Builds lower than 18362 do not support WSL 2. Use the Windows Update Assistant to update your version of Windows.
Now we'll enable the virtual machine feature in your machine, WSL runs in a virtual environment, it's like running a computer inside of another computer!
Enter the following in `powershell` with **`admin`** privileges:
```ps
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```
**At this point, you must restart your machine!**
### Installing The Linux Kernal Update Package
Install the following package from this **[LINK](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi)**
It's safe I promise!
Open `powershell` again with **`admin`** privileges and enter the following:
```ps
wsl --set-default-version 2
```
Let's install our linux distribution, we recommend Ubuntu 18.04 which you can download from this **[LINK](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N9TNGVNDL3Q)**. It will take you directly to the microsoft store.
Here's a list of all supported distributions:
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- openSUSE Leap 15.1
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1
- Kali Linux
- Debian GNU/Linux
- Fedora Remix for WSL
- Pengwin
- Pengwin Enterprise
- Alpine WSL
Once you reach the Microsoft store, click the `Get` button to download and install Ubuntu 18.04.
Once the download completes, you should be prompted with a terminal window:
![Bash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/media/ubuntuinstall.png)
Enter a username and password, we recommend setting these the same as your windows os login!
Now let's ensure that the Ubuntu environment is on WSL2, enter the following into `powershell` as an **`admin`**:
```ps
wsl --list --verbose
```
From the list given, find the Ubuntu instance and add the information to the next command:
```sh
wsl --set-version <distribution name> <versionNumber>
```
Once these steps are completed, you should be able to open your Ubuntu environment, by selecting it from your start menu, we recommend pinning it to your taskbar. Keep the Ubuntu terminal open for the remainder of this walkthrough.
### Optional (Windows)
You can download the new windows terminal **[HERE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started)**.
## Updating The Linux Environment
Before proceeding, run the following command in your terminal or Ubuntu for windows users:
```sh
sudo apt update
```
## Installing Git
Git is a version control manager that we'll be utilizing throughout this program. Install it by entering the following command into your terminal:
```sh
sudo apt-get install git
```
Let's configure Git.
Enter the next commands into your terminal:
```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
Replace your `Your Name` with your name from Github.
```sh
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
```
Replace `youremail@domain.com` with the email you have registered with Github.
### Setting Up Our Github SSH Keys
Ssh keys are used to identify machines/users via an encoded key.
To create a ssh key, enter the following command in your terminal:
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
**NOTE**: Be sure to replace `your_email@example.com` with your email that you have registered with Github.
When you're prompted to `Enter a file in which to save the key,` press Enter. This accepts the default file location.
When prompted for a password, hit the enter key twice to skip this step:
```sh
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
```
We'll now start the ssh agent, enter the following into your terminal:
```sh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
Now enter the following into your terminal:
```sh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
Now let's install `xclip`. `xclip` is used so that we can copy items into our clipboard, enter the following into your terminal:
```sh
sudo apt-get install xclip
```
Now we can copy our ssh key:
```sh
xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
Follow the steps outlined **[HERE](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)** starting from step 2, we've already completed step 1.
## Installing Fish and Oh-My-Fish
### Installing Fish
What is Fish? Fish is a shell designed for interactive use, it provides us with useful shortcuts to execute terminal commands faster and also enables auto completion.
To install Fish, execute the following commands in your terminal:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fish
```
### Installing Oh-My-Fish
Oh-My-Zsh is an extension of the Zsh prompt. It provides us with useful information in a clear and legible format.
Install Oh-My-Fish by running the following command in your terminal:
```sh
curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish
```
A prompt will appear to ask if you want to switch your shell to Fish, select `yes`.
Close your terminal and re-open it, Oh-My-Fish should load by default.

OOPS curl is not working? We got you fam, hold thy purse.
```sh
sudo apt install curl
```
Last step (optional) make Fish the default shell:
```sh
chsh -s `which fish`
```
## Installing VsCode
VsCode is going to be our text editor of choice for this course.
You can download it **[HERE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**
Once downloaded, go ahead and run the installer. Once the installer completes, open VsCode.
### Installing The WSL Remote Extension (Windows)
Once you open VsCode, you may be prompted to install the Remote WSL Extension. Go ahead and do so. If you are not prompted, you can download it **[HERE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)**.
Type in `code .` in your terminal.
This should open a VsCode window.
If the above does not work, open VsCode which will be located in your Applications folder. Once a VsCode window opens, press and hold cmd+shift+p to open the command pallete. In the command pallate, type in path and an option named:
Shell Command: Install code command in PATH.
Select this option and reconfirm the code . command in your terminal.
## Installing NodeJS
NodeJS is a runtime environment that allows us to run javascript outside of a browser.
To install NodeJS, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
sudo apt install nodejs
```
Confirm the installation with the following command:
```sh
nodejs --version
```
## Installing Python3
We'll be learning the Python language later on in this course.
To install Python3, enter the following command in your terminal:
```sh
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip ipython3
```
Confirm the installation with the following command:
```sh
python3 --version
```
## Installing Heroku (Not Fk Heroku) Installing Vercel!
Vercel is a hosting site that we'll be using to deploy projects.
Execute the following in your terminal to install the Vercel CLI:
